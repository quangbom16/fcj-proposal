# Malware Analysis & Threat Intelligence Platform
## A Unified Web-Based Solution for Suspicious File and URL Analysis

### 1. Executive Summary
The Malware Analysis & Threat Intelligence Platform is designed for a university research group in Ho Chi Minh City to enhance malware detection and threat intelligence sharing. It enables users to upload suspicious files, domains, IP addresses, and URLs for automated analysis. Inspired by VirusTotal, the platform integrates multiple scanning engines and open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds, while operating on a smaller scale for academic and research purposes. The system supports 10–15 active researchers, providing real-time detection, collaborative sharing, and secure access via role-based authentication.

### 2. Problem Statement
#### What’s the Problem?
Traditional malware analysis requires multiple isolated tools, manual correlation, and lacks centralized results. Existing commercial services like VirusTotal are powerful but limited by privacy concerns, access restrictions, or high subscription costs. This creates difficulties for researchers and students who need a controlled platform for hands-on security experiments.

#### The Solution
The platform provides a unified web interface where users can:
- Upload suspicious files (executables, scripts, documents).
- Submit domains, IPs, and URLs for analysis.
- Automatically scan inputs against integrated antivirus engines, sandbox environments, and OSINT feeds.
- Correlate results with threat intelligence sources for better detection accuracy.
- Share anonymized results with the research community for collaborative defense.

The backend leverages **serverless and container-based services**:
- **File ingestion** via API Gateway and serverless storage (Amazon S3).
- **Analysis engines** orchestrated with AWS Lambda and ECS Fargate for sandboxing and signature scans.
- **Threat intelligence feeds** integrated through AWS Glue jobs and DynamoDB.
- **Web interface** built with Next.js and AWS Amplify for responsive dashboards.
- **Secure authentication** through Amazon Cognito to control access by research members.

### 3. Benefits and Return on Investment
The platform serves as a **cybersecurity learning and research tool**, allowing lab members to experiment with malware detection pipelines and enrich their knowledge of threat intelligence. It simplifies workflows by centralizing multiple analysis tools in one place, reducing manual effort and increasing reliability.

**Key benefits include:**
- Hands-on experience for students and researchers in malware analysis.
- Faster detection of suspicious content through real-time scanning.
- A foundation for future integration with AI-based detection models.
- Collaboration opportunities by securely sharing anonymized reports.
- Cost efficiency using AWS serverless pricing (estimated <$10/month).

By minimizing manual analysis steps and consolidating data, the platform achieves a break-even period of 6–12 months through reduced operational effort, while providing long-term academic and research value.
